Health Benefits of Drinking Buttermilk:

Natural Coolant for the Body:
Buttermilk is amazingly refreshing and quickly cools down our bodies. A glass of buttermilk topped with cumin seeds, mint, and salt, is well suited to quench our thirst and cools our bodies in the hot summer months from April to July. We can also top it with ice cubes, an excellent alternative to chemical-laden cold drinks. A glass of buttermilk can also provide relief to post-menopausal women who experience hot flashes.

GPT-4 attempts to go AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) with GitHubâ€™s autonomous (auto)-GPT. The generative AI model develops and executes prompts that can lead to new prompts based on initial input.

This approach becomes truly powerful when combined with tools such as web search or the ability to test written code. The language model becomes an automatic assistant that can do much more than just generate text or code.

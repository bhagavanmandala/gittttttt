Here's what's changing
The new billing engine will provide a single space to view, manage, and customize all activities related to your Atlassian cloud subscriptions. This change allows us to provide you with an improved billing experience alongside best‑in‑class customer support.
Please note, this change will not affect your current access to sites, subscription set, or product cost. Additionally, your users' product use will not be interrupted.
A unified system, still in the works
